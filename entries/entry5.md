## Overview 
Last week After all the errors I encountered throughout my project, I struggled to solve these problems myself. So I looked to forums for answers and came with a huge revelation that created a massive shift in my independent study. 


## Intervention
At this point, I realized my progress in understanding how to use the Google calendar API with Ruby was extremely slow at best, and non existent in terms of my final product. 
So it was time for an intervention from my teacher. After discussing my situation we came with two options, reach out online for help, or totally restructure my project and go back to square one, of course, to be safe,  I chose the former. 


## SOS
I reached out on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55895909/google-freebusy-api-method-returning-not-found-error?noredirect=1#comment98459000_55895909) and got a response on my first day by a Product Director at Vista Entertainment Solutions Limited who based on his previous posts, showed himself to be very experienced in Ruby. He tried his best to understand and help me, but it was clear that he was struggling to understand himself, as his suggested solutions didn't make a difference. Still, I sincerely appreciate him trying, as no one else has responded in this past week.
I continued to spend my time looking for forums that resembled my issue, but I realized I struggled to find discussions on StackOverflow regarding the using Ruby with the Google calendar API. It was a lot easier to find discussions with the Google calendar API in languages like Ruby on rails, or JavaScript. 
I then searched through forums one of Google's own websites called Google Groups. In Google Groups you could filter searches specifically to forums that discuss using the Google calendar API with Ruby. With this, I found ABSOLUTELY nothing even related to my issue. In fact, only 21 forums existed within this topic. One [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-api-ruby-client/eOzk1-BmbFQ)  even pointed out how inactive the group for Google calendar API really was. 
So I realized that 'Google groups' is dead. More than that, however, I realized that RUBY IS DEAD, at least in terms of support for this API.


## My next steps
Though all may seem lost, I decided to keep pursuing with this project, but in a  different direction. I think its best to try using a language that would be better supported and more popular, like javascript, so that I could have better help. 

## Takeaway
KEEP MOVING FORWARD
It's easy to give up, but that doesn't always make it the right decision. Sometimes you have to keep pursuing even when things get incredibly rough. With me, it feels like I'm running out of options, but when the going gets tough, is when you get going.
