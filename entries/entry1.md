# <center>Entry 1: Where do I begin </center>

### <strong>Choosing a Topic</strong>
  
They say the hardest part of any project is getting started, that the "journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step". Except if there is anything this week has taught me, the most obvious lesson is that the hardest part is not just starting, but knowing WHERE to start. 

With this being my first time being in charge of my own learning for my own project, knowing I had the freedom to learn whatever I want was quite overwhelming. Therefore, this whole week focused on finding what I should learn, and so I began my research to find a topic

I started out looking into the languages that are required of a software engineer at the most popular companies. Being that software engineering is a passion I wish to pursue, it seemed to make the most sense to me. 

In my search on Glassdoor, a website that reviews companies and their management, as well as providing information for the jobs at said companies, I found that businesses like Google or Squarespace wanted their workers to have experience in general purpose languages as well as the understanding of Algorithms And Data Structure.  I began my search into python an object-oriented, high-level programming language and I discovered a variety of related topics. The most interesting being machine learning. It seemed like a great idea, but I couldnâ€™t think of anything I would make with it, and so I continued my search into a topic I would pursue, keeping a python in mind.

Soon after I found a website called freecodecamp which offers free coding related certifications and so took an interest in taking javascript. I got through most of the basics within the course it which felt like the basics of any other language, until I came to a surprising conclusion.  
That all languages generally share the same concepts on the surface, and are unqiue only when going beyond the basics and dive deep into the language. 

This became an outstanding epiphany, as I realized that my importance should not be placed upon the language itself, but more on what you wish to build and what language you can use to build it. 

So, at last, I decided to possibly save machine learning and javascript for later and instead set my sights on what I want to build next... Which I still needed to think about. 

<strong>Takeaways</strong>    
Many languages share key concepts, if you want to find which one to learn, discover what makes it unique and then you will find one that interests you. 

It's great to have an idea of what you want your final project to be like, to know what you're going to make. Programming languages are tools, so you should learn them based on what tools you would need to learn.
